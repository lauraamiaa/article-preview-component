# Article Preview Component

## Why I Built This
This project was completed as part of a frontend challenge to test my skills in building an interactive component. It was also my first time using Tailwind CSS, so I used this challenge as an opportunity to learn and explore Tailwind's utility-first approach to styling.

## Features
- An article preview section with interactive elements.
- Clean and responsive design built with Tailwind CSS.
- Simple JavaScript logic for handling any dynamic behavior in the component.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: For the structure of the component.
- JavaScript: For interactivity and any dynamic functionality.
- Tailwind CSS: For styling and layout using utility classes.

## Live Demo
The project is deployed using GitHub Pages. You can view the live demo [here](https://lauraamiaa.github.io/article-preview-component/).
